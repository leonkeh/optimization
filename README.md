# Leon's optimization library
Small ongoing project to implement various optimization algorithms that I studied in the course
"Optimization for Systems and Control" at TU Delft.

My motivation for this project is, that many practical problems require iterations
of existing optimization algorithms. E.g. computing the vertices of a convex polytope from the
intersection of halfspaces, can be recasted as obtaining the intermediate results of the
simplex algorithm.

See the flowchart to select an algorithm based on the problem structure.
